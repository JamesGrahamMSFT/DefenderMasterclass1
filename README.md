You will be provided with access to a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint tenant to complete the attack scenario challenges. Please note, you will not be able to use this tenant to complete the Teams/PowerPlatform integration lab.

To complete the Microsoft Defender Teams/PowerPlatform integration lab please ensure you have completed the Labs - Getting Started guidance. This is not required if you already have access to an existing non production tenant.
