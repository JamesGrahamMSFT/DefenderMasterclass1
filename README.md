You will be provided with access to a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint tenant to complete the attack scenario challenges. Please note, you will not be able to use this tenant to complete the Teams/PowerPlatform integration lab. Attack Scenario tenant is now closed - a new tenant will be made available for Masterclass II. 

Please ensure you can navigate to and access https://securitycenter.microsoft.com from a device. Please note - you're corporate device may have tenant restrictions in place which will prevent you from logging into another tenant. 

To complete the Microsoft Defender Teams/PowerPlatform integration lab please ensure you have completed the Labs - Getting Started guidance. This is not required if you already have access to an existing non production tenant.
